# 👋 Hi, I'm Bryce 

🚀 **Software Engineer | Content Creator | Lifelong Learner**

I’m a **Software Engineer** studying at **Western Governors University** since 2024, driven by a passion for building technology that makes everyday life better.  
As a **content creator with over 75,000 subscribers**, I’ve learned how to blend creativity and problem-solving — and now I’m channeling that into projects that make learning interactive and accessible.  

I’m looking for more opportunities to **grow in a professional setting**, collaborate with **curious, like-minded people**, and continue learning while contributing to **meaningful full-time work** in software development.
